### What is this mod?
This is a mod to try and make BoneLab parkour more fun, as right now it kinda sucks
### What does this mod add?
This mod adds more specific strength stats, as well as some much needed logic updates. EG: When climbing a wall, if your legs attach to the wall, your arms gain part of your lower strength, as if your legs are helping you.
